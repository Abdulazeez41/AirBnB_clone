An AirBnB console built with Python's cmd package, providing a command-line interface for managing property rentals. The console relies on a JSON file for storage, with data serialization and deserialization ensuring smooth interactions with the file.

For the user experience, the console offers a range of commands through the cmd package, allowing users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) property listings. Each property is represented as a JSON object, capturing details like location, amenities, and availability.

The console utilizes the unittest framework to rigorously test each CRUD functionality, ensuring the reliability and robustness of the system. From creating new property listings to updating existing ones, the console provides a seamless experience for hosts managing their rentals.

The JSON file acts as a persistent storage solution, allowing users to save their property data and retrieve it across console sessions. Serialization ensures that the data is stored in a format that can be easily written to and read from the file.
